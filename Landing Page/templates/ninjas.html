    <h1>Ninjas</h1>
    <p> Historically, the word ninja was not in common use, and a variety of regional colloquialisms evolved <br> to describe what would later be dubbed ninja. 
        Along with shinobi, some examples include monomi ("one who sees"),<br> nokizaru ("macaque on the roof"), rappa ("ruffian"), kusa ("grass") 
        and Iga-mono ("one from Iga").[8] In historical documents, shinobi is almost always used.  </p>
